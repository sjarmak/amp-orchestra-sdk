# Thread Management UI Implementation

## Overview

Successfully updated the Chat UI to support thread management following the Oracle's blueprint. The implementation includes a complete thread management system with UI components for thread selection, creation, renaming, and deletion.

## Components Implemented

### 1. ThreadPicker Component
- **Location**: `/desktop-ui/src/components/Chat/ThreadPicker.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Dropdown interface for selecting threads within current session
  - Thread creation, renaming, and deletion capabilities
  - Keyboard shortcuts (⌘⇧N for new thread)
  - Click-to-confirm deletion pattern
  - Visual indicators for active thread
  - Truncated names for long thread titles

### 2. NewThreadButton Component
- **Location**: `/desktop-ui/src/components/Chat/NewThreadButton.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Dedicated button for thread creation
  - Keyboard shortcut display
  - Consistent styling with theme system

### 3. Updated ThreadsChat Component
- **Location**: `/desktop-ui/src/components/Chat/ThreadsChat.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Integrated SessionManagerContext for proper thread management
  - Implemented Oracle's header layout wireframe
  - Added thread selection, creation, renaming, and deletion handlers
  - Updated header to show thread picker and context switcher

## Header Layout Implementation

Following Oracle's wireframe design:

```
CHAT HEADER    (Threads inside current session)
────────────────────────────────────────────────
Amp   |  Thread:  ⌄ [Fix login bug ▾]   + New thread
      |  Context: [production ▾]
```

The header is organized in two rows:
1. **Thread Management Row**: Thread picker + New thread button
2. **Context Row**: Context switcher + Refresh environment button

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- **⌘⇧N (Cmd+Shift+N)**: Create new thread (works globally when chat is active)

## Integration Points

### SessionManagerContext Integration
- Uses `createThread()`, `switchThread()`, `renameThread()`, `deleteThread()` functions
- Properly handles thread switching with context clearing
- Maintains thread state across sessions

### DualChatContext Integration
- Coordinates with existing chat context system
- Handles thread ID updates and message clearing
- Maintains context switching functionality

## Thread Operations

### Thread Creation
1. Creates new Amp session in backend
2. Adds thread to session's thread list
3. Switches to new thread automatically
4. Clears chat messages for fresh start

### Thread Switching
1. Updates active thread in session
2. Clears current context messages
3. Loads thread-specific conversation

### Thread Renaming
- In-place editing with Enter/Escape controls
- Immediate feedback and validation

### Thread Deletion
- Click-to-confirm pattern for safety
- Auto-switches to another thread if deleting active thread
- Handles edge case when last thread is deleted

## TypeScript Compliance

All components are fully typed with TypeScript interfaces:
- Thread picker props interface
- Proper null/undefined handling
- Type-safe context integration

## Testing Considerations

The implementation includes:
- `data-test-id` attributes for e2e testing
- Keyboard event handling for accessibility
- Error handling for network operations
- Proper loading states and disabled states

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements could include:
- Thread search/filtering
- Thread metadata display (message count, last activity)
- Drag-and-drop reordering
- Thread templates or favorites
- Bulk operations on threads
