# Memory Leak Fixes Summary

This document summarizes the comprehensive memory leak fixes implemented to address the Oracle-identified issues causing 990ms long tasks and memory accumulation in the terminal components.

## 🚨 Fixed Issues

### 1. **Subscription Leaks in TerminalManager**
- **Problem**: Tauri event listeners for `process_output` and `process_status` were not properly tracked and cleaned up
- **Solution**: 
  - Added proper async/await handling for listen() calls
  - Added mount tracking with `isMountedRef` to prevent operations after unmount
  - Added comprehensive error handling and cleanup logging
  - Ensured listeners are properly disposed with try/catch blocks

### 2. **Retry Timeout Leaks**
- **Problem**: Auto-retry logic used setTimeout without proper cleanup, causing dangling timeouts
- **Solution**:
  - Added `retryTimeoutsRef` to track all pending retry timeouts
  - Properly clear all timeouts on component unmount
  - Added disposal logging for verification

### 3. **Session Resource Leaks**
- **Problem**: AmpSession dispose() method was incomplete, leaving WebGL contexts and BehaviorSubjects uncleaned
- **Solution**:
  - Enhanced dispose() method with comprehensive resource cleanup
  - Added WebGL/Canvas renderer disposal to prevent GPU memory leaks
  - Added proper BehaviorSubject completion
  - Added disposal guards to prevent async operations after disposal
  - Added detailed logging to verify cleanup

### 4. **ResizeObserver Ping-Pong Effects**
- **Problem**: Multiple ResizeObserver instances causing excessive fit() calls leading to 990ms long tasks
- **Solution**:
  - Created `useThrottledResize` hook with intelligent throttling
  - Uses requestAnimationFrame for smooth resize operations
  - Tracks actual dimension changes to avoid unnecessary work
  - Prevents ping-pong effects with proper throttling logic
  - Created `createSafeResizeObserver` utility with proper error handling

### 5. **Unbounded Scroll Buffer Growth**
- **Problem**: xterm.js terminals had unlimited scrollback causing unbounded memory growth
- **Solution**:
  - Added `scrollback: 1000` limit to terminal configuration
  - Prevents memory growth from long-running sessions

### 6. **Disposal Guards for Async Operations**
- **Problem**: Async operations continued after component unmount, causing state updates on unmounted components
- **Solution**:
  - Added `isMountedRef` tracking in TerminalManagerContext
  - Added disposal guards in session spawn operations
  - Clear pending creation promises on unmount
  - Proper async operation cancellation

## 📁 Modified Files

### Core Session Management
- **`TerminalManagerContext.tsx`**: Fixed event listener leaks, retry timeout tracking, disposal guards
- **`session.ts`**: Enhanced dispose() method, added scroll buffer limits, improved resource cleanup

### Resize Handling
- **`useThrottledResize.ts`**: New throttled resize hook with ping-pong prevention
- **`TerminalViewNew.tsx`**: Updated to use new throttled resize system

## 🔧 Key Technical Improvements

### Memory Management
```typescript
// Before: Basic cleanup
dispose(): void {
  this.term.dispose()
  this.status.complete()
}

// After: Comprehensive cleanup
dispose(): void {
  // Dispose renderer to prevent WebGL leaks
  if (this.renderer) {
    this.renderer.dispose()
    this.renderer = null
  }
  
  // Clear all timeouts
  if (this.writeTimeoutId !== null) {
    clearTimeout(this.writeTimeoutId)
    this.writeTimeoutId = null
  }
  
  // Complete BehaviorSubject properly
  this.status.complete()
  
  // Clear buffers
  this.writeBuffer = ''
}
```

### Throttled Resize System
```typescript
// Prevents ResizeObserver ping-pong with intelligent throttling
const { handleResize, cleanup } = useThrottledResize({
  terminal: xtermRef.current,
  fitAddon: fitAddonRef.current,
  onDimensionChange: (cols, rows) => {
    // Only resize if dimensions actually changed
    tuiSession.resize(cols, rows)
  },
  throttleMs: 100
})
```

### Subscription Tracking
```typescript
// Proper async listener setup with mount tracking
useEffect(() => {
  let isMounted = true
  let unlistenFn: (() => void) | null = null
  
  const setupListener = async () => {
    unlistenFn = await listen('process_output', (event) => {
      if (!isMounted) return // Disposal guard
      // Handle event
    })
  }
  
  return () => {
    isMounted = false
    if (unlistenFn) unlistenFn()
  }
}, [])
```

## ✅ Verification Features

### Comprehensive Logging
- Added disposal verification logs for all resource types
- Timeout cleanup logging
- Event listener establishment/cleanup logging
- Session lifecycle logging

### Resource Tracking
- Mount state tracking with `isMountedRef`
- Timeout ID tracking with proper cleanup
- Renderer addon disposal verification
- BehaviorSubject completion logging

## 🎯 Expected Performance Impact

1. **Eliminated 990ms Long Tasks**: Throttled resize prevents ResizeObserver ping-pong
2. **Reduced Memory Growth**: Scroll buffer limits and proper resource disposal
3. **Prevented Memory Leaks**: Complete cleanup of WebGL contexts, timers, and subscriptions
4. **Improved Responsiveness**: Proper async operation cancellation prevents unnecessary work

## 🧪 Testing Recommendations

1. **Monitor Memory Usage**: Watch for memory growth during rapid resize events
2. **Check Console Logs**: Verify disposal messages appear during component unmount
3. **Performance Profiling**: Confirm elimination of 990ms tasks in DevTools
4. **Long-running Sessions**: Test memory stability over extended terminal usage

The fixes comprehensively address all Oracle-identified memory leak sources while maintaining full functionality and adding robust error handling.
