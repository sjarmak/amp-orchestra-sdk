# Conductor-Style Layout Implementation Summary

This document outlines the successful implementation of the new Conductor-style three-panel layout for Amp Orchestra, based on the Oracle's specifications.

## Overview

The new layout replaces the old file-explorer based interface with a sophisticated three-panel workspace management system that mirrors Conductor.build's patterns while maintaining clean integration with the existing chat functionality.

## Architecture

### Three-Panel Layout Structure

1. **Left Panel (Sidebar)**: Repository-based workspace navigation
2. **Center Panel**: Chat interface with terminal/diff tabs toggle
3. **Right Panel**: Terminal and diff tabs system

## Implemented Components

### 1. Context Providers

#### `RepositoryContext.tsx`
- Manages workspace and repository state
- Handles repository operations (add, remove, switch)
- Provides active repository tracking
- Supports multiple workspaces with repository collections

#### `WorkspaceContext.tsx` 
- Manages open files and workspace state
- Handles file operations (open, close, save)
- Tracks recent files and expanded directories
- Provides file search capabilities

### 2. UI Components

#### `RepositoryNode.tsx`
- Displays individual repository information
- Shows branch status and activity indicators
- Provides repository management actions
- Expandable to show additional details

#### `WorkspaceNode.tsx`
- Container for repository collections
- Workspace-level management actions
- Add/remove repository functionality
- Collapsible workspace sections

#### `ConductorSidebar.tsx`
- Main left panel implementation
- Workspace search functionality
- Recent files section
- Repository addition workflows

### 3. Layout Components

#### `ChatArea.tsx`
- Wraps the existing Chat component
- Maintains compatibility with current chat functionality

#### `TerminalAndDiffTabs.tsx`
- Sophisticated tab management system
- Support for multiple terminal sessions
- Diff view integration
- Tab creation and management

#### `DiffTab.tsx`
- File diff visualization
- Git integration for file changes
- File picker for manual diff selection
- Live diff refresh capabilities

#### `ConductorLayout.tsx`
- Main layout orchestrator
- Panel visibility management
- Keyboard shortcuts (Cmd+B, Cmd+Shift+T, Cmd+K)
- View mode switching (Chat/Terminal)

## Technical Features

### State Management
- React Context patterns for cross-component state sharing
- Proper separation of concerns between repository and workspace state
- Persistent state management for UI preferences

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- `Cmd/Ctrl + K`: Focus chat input
- `Cmd/Ctrl + B`: Toggle sidebar
- `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + T`: Toggle right panel

### Integration Points
- Seamless integration with existing AmpModeProvider
- Compatible with current session management
- Maintains all existing chat functionality

### Backend Integration
Added new Tauri commands:
- `get_current_branch`: Git branch detection
- `get_file_diff`: File diff generation  
- `write_file`: Enhanced file writing with directory creation

## Design Compliance

The implementation follows the AGENTS.md design guidelines:

- ✅ Three-panel layout (sidebar, main content, right panel)
- ✅ Dark/light mode support with CSS custom properties  
- ✅ Lucide React icons (no emojis)
- ✅ Clean borders and subtle shadows
- ✅ Generous whitespace and proper spacing
- ✅ Modern rounded corners and hover states
- ✅ Responsive design with collapsible panels

## Migration Path

The new layout completely replaces the old App.tsx structure:

**Before**: File explorer + Chat/Terminal toggle + Changes panel
**After**: Repository sidebar + Chat area + Terminal/diff tabs

The migration maintains:
- All existing chat functionality
- Terminal session management
- Theme system
- Profile management
- Agent mode and toolbox selection

## Next Steps

This implementation provides the foundation for:

1. **Enhanced Git Integration**: The repository-based structure supports advanced git worktree operations
2. **Multi-Repository Workflows**: Users can work across multiple repositories simultaneously  
3. **Advanced Diff Capabilities**: The diff tab system can be extended for more sophisticated change visualization
4. **Workspace Persistence**: Repository and workspace state can be persisted for session continuity

## Conclusion

The Conductor-style layout implementation successfully modernizes the Amp Orchestra interface while maintaining full backward compatibility. The new architecture provides a scalable foundation for advanced workspace management features and improves the overall developer experience through better organization and more intuitive navigation patterns.
